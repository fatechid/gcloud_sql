# Simple Gcloud SQL Connection with Python

This is a pretty big security issue
That's why we use SSL encryption to restrict access to our instance.

edit this line with your instance

**DB_server = "your_host"**
**DB_username = "your_username"**
**DB_password = "your_password"**

also we can create database when connection is successfully.
**database_input = input("Enter your database name: ") #database name**
**cursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE " + database_input)  #create a new database**
